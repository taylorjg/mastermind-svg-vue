# Description

I previously implemented [Mastermind in React](https://github.com/taylorjg/Mastermind).
However, the UI is very poor. I decided to try to improve it by using SVG.
I created this separate repo to play around with it.

# TODO

## UI things

* [x] Add HTML "New Game" button
* [x] Add HTML "Enter" button to enter a guess
* [x] Show/hide secret panel cover
* [x] Allow selection of a peg colour from a colour menu
* [x] Add focus circles to the large peg holes for the active row
* [x] Use SVG buttons instead of HTML buttons
* [x] Add some fanfare around game won/lost
* [ ] Add shine/gloss to large/small pegs
* [ ] Add animations (e.g. when revealing the secret code)
* [x] Responsive UI: size of device
* [ ] Responsive UI: orientation of device
* [ ] Provide a UI mechanism to toggle autosolve mode

## Non-UI things

* [x] Add basic game logic
* [x] Use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (my first Vue.js app!)
* [x] Deploy to gh-pages
* [x] Implement [autosolve mode](https://taylorjg.github.io/mastermind-svg-vue?autosolve)
